Files are recording with Spike2 and saved in .smrx format.  The Spike2 recording configuration and script for export of data to .mat format are included. 

The pipeline as is consists of two Jupyter Notebooks that are adapted to taking .mat files for feature extraction, training and classification. 

These scripts have been assigned a GNU GPL 3.0 license.
